# opengl
Messing with OpenGL 

This is a pretty basic opengl app. 

Displays a blank window using a external c++ library. 

Reason for making this is to simply learn the syntax of a makefile, 

and to save time from struggling to link/include libraries using xcode 

to build a simple opengl app...

If you get a "makefile : missing separator", then just adjust the last

line of the makefile. Use tab instead of spaces..
